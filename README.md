# How does it work?
Project S.O.D.A. works by utilizing 3 angled ultrasonic sensors and 3 vibration motors. The vibration motors are placed on the stick where the user's palm would rest. The ultrasonic sensors are placed near the center of the stick and stay parallel to the ground. Each ultrasonic sensor connects to one of the vibration motor. When an object is detected in one of the ultrasonic sensors, its specific vibration motor buzzes. Depending on which vibration motor buzzes, the user can pinpoint where the object is located.
